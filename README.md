# Cordova Facebook Connect Plugin #
by [Olivier Louvignes](http://olouv.com)

## DESCRIPTION ##

* This plugin provides a simple way to use Facebook Graph API in Cordova.

* This plugin is built for Cordova >= v2.1.0 with ARC. Both iOS & Android are supported with the same javascript interface.

* For iOS, this plugin relies on the [Facebook iOS SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk) that is bundled in the `FacebookSDK` folder (licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0).

* For Android, this plugin relies on the [Facebook Android SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk) that is packaged as a .jar in the `libs` folder (licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0).

* Regarding the existing implementation : [phonegap-plugin-facebook-connect](https://github.com/davejohnson/phonegap-plugin-facebook-connect) built by Dave Johnson, this version does not require the Facebook JS sdk (redundant to native sdk). It is also quite easier to use (unified login & initial /me request) and it does support multiple graph requests (strong callback handling).

## SAMPLE PROJECT GENERATION ##

You can generate a sample XCode project by running `samples/ios/create.sh` from the root of the repository.

## PLUGIN SETUP FOR IOS ##

Using this plugin requires [Cordova iOS](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-ios).

1. Make sure your Xcode project has been [updated for Cordova](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-ios/blob/master/guides/Cordova%20Upgrade%20Guide.md)
2. Rename the `ios` folder to `FacebookConnect`, drag and drop it from Finder to your Plugins folder in XCode, using "Create groups for any added folders"
3. Add the .js files to your `www` folder on disk, and add reference(s) to the .js files using `<script>` tags in your html file(s)


    `<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/plugins/FacebookConnect.js"></script>`


4. Add new entry with key `FacebookConnect` and value `FacebookConnect` to `Plugins` in `Cordova.plist/Cordova.plist`

5. In the Build Settings tab, search for Other Linker Flags. Add the value `-lsqlite3.0`.

6. In the Build Phases tab, link binary with libraries section. Add the Social.framework, Accounts.framework and AdSupport.framework frameworks. Make them optional to support pre-iOS6 devices.

7. Modify your application .plist according to the [Facebook iOS : Getting started guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-with-the-ios-sdk/#project), check the `Modify the app property list file` section.

>
   create an array key called URL types with a single array sub-item called URL Schemes. Give this a single item with your app ID prefixed with fb: [ScreenShot](https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/iosappid2.png). This is used to ensure the application will receive the callback URL of the web-based OAuth flow.

## PLUGIN SETUP FOR ANDROID ##

Using this plugin requires [Cordova Android](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-android).

1. Make sure your Android project has been [updated for Cordova](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-android/blob/master/guides/Cordova%20Upgrade%20Guide.md)
2. Add the `src/android` folder from this plugin to your projet.
3. Refresh (fn-F5), right-click on the `facebook-android-sdk.jar` & select `Build path > Add to build path` (the debug version will output to the console).
3. Add the .js files to your `assets/www` folder on disk, and add reference(s) to the .js files using `<script>` tags in your html file(s)


    `<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/plugins/FacebookConnect.js"></script>`


4. Add new entry with key `FacebookConnect` and value `org.apache.cordova.plugins.FacebookConnect` to `Plugins` in `res/xml/config.xml`


    <plugin name="FacebookConnect" value="org.apache.cordova.plugins.FacebookConnect"/>


## JAVASCRIPT INTERFACE (IOS/ANDROID) ##

    // After device ready, create a local alias
    var facebookConnect = window.plugins.facebookConnect;

    facebookConnect.login({permissions: ["email", "user_about_me"], appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"}, function(result) {
        console.log("FacebookConnect.login:" + JSON.stringify(result));

        // Check for cancellation/error
        if(result.cancelled || result.error) {
            console.log("FacebookConnect.login:failedWithError:" + result.message);
            return;
        }

        // Basic graph request example
        facebookConnect.requestWithGraphPath("/me/friends", {limit: 100}, function(result) {
            console.log("FacebookConnect.requestWithGraphPath:" + JSON.stringify(result));
        });

        // Feed dialog example
        var dialogOptions = {
            link: 'https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/',
            picture: 'http://fbrell.com/f8.jpg',
            name: 'Facebook Dialogs',
            caption: 'Reference Documentation',
            description: 'Using Dialogs to interact with users.'
        };
        facebookConnect.dialog('feed', dialogOptions, function(response) {
            console.log("FacebookConnect.dialog:" + JSON.stringify(response));
        });

    });

Patches welcome! Send a pull request. Since this is not a part of Cordova Core (which requires a CLA), this should be easier.
